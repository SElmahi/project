<div><p>The International Conference on Advanced Research in Technologies, Information, Innovation and Sustainability (ARTIIS 2023), to be held at Universidad a Distancia de Madrid, Spain,  between the 18th and 20th of October 2023.

    ARTIIS, is an international forum for researchers and practitioners to present and discuss the most recent innovations, trends, results, experiences, and concerns in the area of Information Systems (IS), focusing on four topics: computing solutions, data intelligence, sustainability, Ethics, Security, and Privacy; with some particularities being addressed within each of them. IS encompasses the use of technology and data to support various organizational and societal functions. The topics are closely related to the field of IS because all of them involve the use and management of technology and data to achieve specific purposes or goals. Computing Solutions are a crucial aspect of information systems as they provide the technical infrastructure and tools for organizations to manage and process data. Data Intelligence is also a key area of information systems as it involves the collection, analysis, and interpretation of data to support decision-making and problem-solving. Sustainability is becoming an increasingly important aspect of information systems as organizations are recognizing the impact of technology on the environment and are looking for ways to reduce their carbon footprint. Ethics, Security, and Privacy are also essential aspects of information systems as they involve the responsible and secure use of technology and data to protect individuals and organizations from potential harm.
    
    New digital evolution and transformation trends, are enabling communication and ubiquitous computing between global citizens, industry, organizations, networked machines and physical objects, providing a promising vision of the future integrating the real world of knowledge agents and things with the virtual world of information.
    The current reality and the future of computing and communications, are supported by a dynamical technological evolution in many fields, from wireless sensors, wireless sensor networks, to nanotechnology, 
    
    Due to its broad impact in many fields, it has rapidly gained global attention from academia, governments, industry and citizenship. This change in the network of agency profoundly modifies the landscape of human activity, particularly as regards knowledge acquisition and production, offering new possibilities but also challenges that need to be explored and assessed.</p></div>
